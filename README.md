dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. Currently vim and emacs configurations with some mild support for installing - `init.sh`.

emacs

I have recently switched to [emacs-live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live) but not yet forked and include it here. My emacs-configuration can be found under .live-packs.

vim
