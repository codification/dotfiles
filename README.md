dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles. Currently vim and emacs configurations with some mild support for installing - `init.sh`.

emacs
-----

I have recently switched to [emacs-live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live) but not yet forked and include it here. My emacs-configuration can be found under .live-packs.

vim
---

I started using pathogen long ago but have not migrated all plugins there. Currently I "incubate" bundles under "bundles/always" on every startup and bundles under "bundles/python" if vim is compiled with python support.
